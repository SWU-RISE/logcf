Firstly, thanks very much for  reviewers'  commonts and suggestions.
Follow the commonts we do bellow modifies: 
1) We have corrected some of english problems by  reviewers  commonts.
2) We given an example to demonstrate the theorems and algorithms.
3) We add some word description  parts to expression the theorems and algorithms.
4) We separate the theorems and algorithms into two sections.
5) We simplifies the descriptions of algorithms.
6) We add some noations in proof of theorem 5, make it more clear.

We will answer some questions of reviewers.
1) Why the new  tool is more eddicient than other tools?
We use one example in this paper to explain that our method can given an upper bound less than
sate of art one which given in reference paper.

2)Is the improvement related to particular types of polynomials?
Logcf is not improvement related to particular types of polynomials. As the results
show logcf has good profermance in difference type polynomials. But, in general,
there is no real root isolation method better than others in every cases. And logcf
is also slower than other tool in some cases.

3) Have your found the case when your method is less efficient than state of art implementations and why?
As in Figure 4, logcf is slower than RootIntervals on WPn polynomials. We do not get the reason of this
phenomenon.
