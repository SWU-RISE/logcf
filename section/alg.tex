\section{Algorithm based on  continued fraction}
In this section, we first recall Descartes' rule of signs, which gives a bound on the number of positive real roots. Then the Vincent theorem, which  ensures
the termination of algorithms based on  continued fraction, is presented. Finally, we review an algorithm of real root isolation based on  continued fraction.
%and the using the notation of \cite{akr05}.

As usual, $\deg(p)$ denotes the degree of univariate polynomial $p$. The derivative of polynomial $p$ with respect to the only variable is denoted by $p'$ and $\gcd(f,g)$ means the greatest common divisor of polynomials $f$ and $g$.

\begin{note}[Sign variation]
Let $S=\left\{ a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_n \right\}$ be a finite sequence of non-zero real numbers. Define $V(S)$, the {\em sign variation} of $S$, as follows.
\[V(S)=0\ \text{ if } |S|\le1,\]
\[  V(a_0,\ldots,a_{n-1},a_n)=  \left\{\begin{aligned}
 &  V(a_0,\ldots,a_{n-1})+1 \text{ if }a_{n-1}a_n<0;\\
&V(a_0,\ldots,a_{n-1}), \text{ otherwise}.\\
	\end{aligned}
	\right.
\]
If some elements of $S$ are zero, remove those zero-elements to get a new sequence and define $V(S)$ to be the sign variation of this new sequence.

%Using the above notations, we recall Descarts' rule of signs:

\begin{theorem}[Descartes' rule of signs] \label{thm:des}
  Suppose $p=\sum_{i=0}^na_ix^i\in\RR[x]$ has $m$ positive real roots, counted with multiplicity. Set $V(p)=V(a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_n)$. Then $m\le V(p)$, and $V(p)-m$ is even.
\end{theorem}

%For a polynomial $p\in \RR[x]$, modern algorithm map the considered interval to $(0,\infty)$ to get a polynomial $p_1$  and guarantee  that two polynomials' real roots have one-to-one correspondence. Theorem \ref{thm:des} gives a upper bound of number of
%positive real roots, which can guarantee the correctness of Continued Fractions algorithm.

 \begin{comment}
A modern version of the algorithm has been invented by \cite{collin76}. The original method  firstly map all the positive real roots in $(0,1)$, then use bisection strategy and show
that if transformations $H_{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $H_{\frac{1}{2}}T$ are applied iteratively on any square-free polynomial $P$, one obtain, after a finite number of transformations,
a polynomial $Q$ such that $V(Q)\le 1$. \cite{akr80} modify the subdivision strategy, simply say, it recursion  computer the lower bound $b$ of positive real roots and shift
$x\leftarrow x+b$, then  first search the real roots in interval $(0,1]$ later in interval $(1,+\infty)$. Until all the positive real roots been found.

The correctness of all the algorithms are based on Theorem  \ref{thm:des}. The proof of the termination and complexity computation of their algorithms is base on the following theorems:

\begin{theorem}[Vincent's theorem]\label{thm:vin}
  Let $p(x)$ be a real polynomial of degree $n$ which has only simple roots. It is possible to determine a positive quantity $\delta$ so that for every pair of positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ with $|b-a| < \delta$, the coefficients sequence of every transformed polynomial of the form
  $  p(x) = (1+x)^{n}p(\frac{a+bx}{1+x}) $
		  has exactly 0 or 1 sign variation. The second case is possible if and only if $p(x)$ has a single root within $(a,b)$.

  Continued fraction based procedures will continue subdividing the considered interval into two subintervals and make a one to one map from $(a,b)$ to $(0,+\infty)$ by $  p(x) = (1+x)^{n}p(\frac{a+bx}{1+x})$ until $V(p)$ equals $1$ or $0$. Therefore, Theorem \ref{thm:vin} guarantees the termination of these  procedures.

\begin{definition} As in \cite{akr05}, we define the following transformations for a univariate polynomial $p(x)$.
  \begin{eqnarray*}
  R(p(x))=x^n(p(\frac{1}{x})),\\
  H_\lambda(p(x))=p(\lambda x),\\
  T(p(x))=p(x+1).
  \end{eqnarray*}
\end{definition}

$T(p)$  is also called	Taylor shift one \cite{ger04,joh05}. In our experiments when Algorithm \ref{alg:up} is used for computing upper bounds, $T(p)$  takes  more than
ninety percent of running time\footnote{the result of  GNU gprof.}.  We have considered methods in \cite{ger04} for computing $T(p)$, but   finally we chose the  classical
method (Horner's method) for its simplicity. In future work we will use Divide \& Conquer method which is the fastest in \cite{ger04}. We think this substituting
will still improve the performance of our method.

$  intvl(a,b,c,d)=  \left\{\begin{aligned}
&  (\min\left\{ \frac{a}{c},\frac{b}{d} \right\},\max\left\{ \frac{a}{c},\frac{b}{d} \right\} ) &\text{ if } cd\neq0;\\
& (0,\infty), &\text{ otherwise}.\\
	\end{aligned}
	\right.
$
\end{definition}


Using the above notations and definitions, an algorithm for isolating all the real roots of a nonzero univariate polynomial is described as Algorithm \ref{alg:main}.
Algorithm \ref{alg:cf}, which has only a little modification of the algorithm in \cite{akr80,akr08}, is presented here to make our subsequent description clearer.
