\section{A  upper bounds of the positive real roots for giving  polynomials}
\label{sec:thm}

One key ingredient of continued fraction based methods is the computation of upper bounds of the positive real roots for giving  polynomials. We give in Theorem \ref{thm:log} a new characteristic of such upper bounds of univariate polynomials. A new algorithm based on this theorem, Algorithm \ref{alg:up}, is proposed for computing upper bounds of positive real roots.


\begin{theorem} \label{thm:log}
  Suppose   $p=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1x+a_0\ (a_n>0)$  is a univariate polynomial in $x$ with real coefficients.  Then  a nonnegative number $u$ is an upper bound of positive roots of $p$ if $u$   satisfies that $\min_{j=0}^{n}\left\{  \sum_{i=j}^n a_i u^{i-j}\right\}\ge0$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  If $n=0$, then $p$ is a nonzero constant and any positive number is its upper bound of positive roots.

  Otherwise, if $b>u$,  we {\bf claim} that $\sum_{i=j}^na_ib^{i-j}> \sum_{i=j}^na_iu^{i-j}$ for any $j= 0,\ldots,n-1$.

  When $j=n-1$, $\sum_{i=n-1}^na_ib^{i-n+1}-\sum_{i=n-1}^na_iu^{i-n+1}=a_n(b-u)>0.$ The claim holds.

  Assume the {\bf claim} holds  when $j=k$. When $j=k-1$,  $\sum_{i=k-1}^na_ib^{i-k+1}=\left(\sum_{i=k}^na_ib^{i-k}\right)b+a_{k-1} $. By assumption
  $\sum_{i=k}^na_ib^{i-k}>\sum_{i=k}^na_iu^{i-k}\ge0$. Since $b>u\ge0$, $\left(\sum_{i=k}^na_ib^{i-k}\right)b>\left (\sum_{i=k}^na_iu^{i-k} \right)u  $
  and $\sum_{i=k-1}^na_ib^{i-k+1}> \sum_{i=k-1}^na_iu^{i-k+1}$. So  $\sum_{i=j}^na_ib^{i-j}> \sum_{i=j}^na_iu^{i-j}$ for any $j= 0,\ldots,n-1$.


  By the above claim,   $p(b)=\sum_{i=0}^na_ib^i>0$ when  $b>u$. Because $b$ is arbitrarily chosen, $u$ is an upper bound of the positive roots of $p$.

\end{proof}


The following theorem was given by Akritas et al. in  \cite{akr08}, which computes positive root upper bounds of univariate polynomials.

\begin{theorem}[Akritas-Strzebo\'{n}ski-Vigklas, \cite{akr08}] \label{thm:qup}

  Let $p(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_0\ (a_n>0)$ be a polynomial with real coefficients and let $d(p)$ and $t(p)$ denote the degree and the number of its terms, respectively.

  Moreover, assume that $p(x)$ can be written as\begin{equation}
	p(x)=q_1(x)-q_2(x)+q_3(x)-q_4(x)+\cdots +q_{2m-1}(x)-q_{2m}(x)+g(x)
	\label{eq:1}
  \end{equation}
  where all the coefficients of polynomials $q_i(x)$ $(i=1,2,\ldots,2m)$ and $g(x)$ are positive. In addition,
  assume that for $i=1,2,\ldots,m$ we have
  \begin{equation*}
	q_{2i-1}(x)=c_{2i-1,1}x^{e_{2i-1,1}}+\cdots+c_{2i-1,t_{2i-1}}x^{e_{2i-1,t_{2i-1}}}
  \end{equation*}
  and
  \begin{equation*}
	q_{2i}(x)=b_{2i,1}x^{e_{2i,1}}+\cdots+b_{2i,t_{2i}}x^{e_{2i,t_{2i}}}
  \end{equation*}
  where $e_{2i-1,1}=d(q_{2i-1})$, $e_{2i,1}=d(q_{2i})$, $t_{2i-1}=t(q_{2i-1}),$ and $t_{2i}=t(q_{2i})$   and the exponent of each term in $q_{2i-1}(x)$ is greater than the exponent of each term in $q_{2i}(x)$. If for all indices $i=1,2,\ldots,m$, we have
  \begin{equation*}
	t(q_{2i-1})\ge t(q_{2i}),
  \end{equation*}
  then an upper bound of the values of the positive roots of $p(x)$ is given by

  \begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
	up= \max_{i=1,2,\ldots,m}\left\{ \max_{j=1,2,\ldots,t_{2i}}\left\{ \left( \frac{b_{2i,j}}{c_{2i-1,j}} \right)^{\frac{1}{e_{2i-1,j}- e_{2i,j} } } \right\}  \right\}
  \end{equation}
  for any permutation of the positive coefficients $c_{2i-1,j}, $ $j=1,2,\ldots,t_{2i-1}$.
  Otherwise, for each of the indices $i$ for which we have
  \begin{equation*}
	t_{2i-1}<t_{2i},
  \end{equation*}
  we {\bf break up} one of the coefficients of $q_{2i-1}(x)$ into $t_{2i}-t_{2i-1} +1$ parts, so that now $t(q_{2i} ) = t(q_{2i-1})$ and apply the same formula (\ref{eq:2}) given above.


\end{theorem}

%\textbf{ Theorem \ref{thm:log} , \ref{thm:qup} all describe the properties of upper bounds of positive real roots. We will claim that all the upper bounds obtain by Theorem
%\ref{thm:qup}  also satisfies Theorem \ref{thm:log} by below theorem. So if there has a method which can work out the  optimal upper bound satisfying Theorem \ref{thm:log}, it will at least better than any method based on Theorem \ref{thm:qup} when only consider the sharp of upper bound.}


We shall show in Theorem \ref{thm:com1} that the bound given by Theorem \ref{thm:log} is better than that given by Theorem \ref{thm:qup}.



% \textbf{ What's more, some time  the  optimal upper bound satisfying Theorem \ref{thm:log}, is sharper than the bound obtain by Theorem \ref{thm:qup}. }





\begin{theorem}\label{thm:com}
	Let $p(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_0\ (a_n>0)$ be a polynomial with real coefficients and   $u$ denote an upper bound of positive roots of $p$ obtained by Theorem \ref{thm:qup}, then $\min_{k=0}^{n}\left\{  \sum_{i=k}^n a_i u^{i-k}\right\}\ge0$.
	
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	%Set $u$ obtains after break up and    permutation of the positive coefficients $c_{2i-1,j}, $ $j=1,2,\ldots,t_{2i-1}$ for  $i=1,2,\ldots,m$.
	
	%For any $k\in n-1,n-2,\ldots,0$.
	For every $ a_i<0$, by Theorem \ref{thm:qup}, there exist  $c_{i_1}x^{e_{i_1}}$ and $b_{i_2}x^{e_{i_2}},$  respectively, such that
	$e_{i_1}>e_{i_2}$ and $c_{i_1}u^{e_{i_1}}\ge b_{i_2}u^{e_{i_2}}$. By  Theorem \ref{thm:qup} $b_{i_2}x^{e_{i_2} }$ is the term $-a_ix^i$
	and $c_{i_1}x^{e_{i_1} }$ is either a whole or a part (broken up by Theorem \ref{thm:qup}) of a positive term of $p$.
	
	For every  $a_j>0$, by Theorem \ref{thm:qup}, $\left( \sum_{a_i<0,e_{i_1}=j }c_{i_1} \right)\le a_{j}$. So \begin{dmath*}\sum_{i=k}^na_iu^i\ge \sum_{i=k,a_i<0}^n \left( c_{i_1}u^{e_{i_1}}-
		b_{i_2}u^{e_{i_2}} \right)\ge 0 \end{dmath*} for any $k= 0,1,\ldots,n$. Then $\sum_{i=k}^n a_i u^{i-k}\ge0 $ for any  $k= 0,1,\ldots,n$ and
	$\min_{k=0}^{n}\left\{  \sum_{i=k}^n a_i u^{i-k}\right\}\ge0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:com1}
	
	Let $p(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_0\ (a_n>0)$ be a polynomial with real coefficients. Let  $u_1$ denote the optimal upper bound of
	positive real roots satisfying Theorem \ref{thm:log} and $u_2$ denote the optimal upper bound of positive real roots satisfying Theorem \ref{thm:qup}, then $u_1\le u_2$ and the  strict inequality can hold.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	By Theorem \ref{thm:com}, $u_1\le u_2$.
	Let $p(x)=x^2+x-2$. Then $u_2=\sqrt{2}$ and $u_1=1$. So
	$u_1<u_2$ for this \rev{$p$}.
\end{proof}
